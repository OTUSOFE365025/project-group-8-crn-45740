| **UC-1** | Merge Multiple Calendars | A student wishes to combine calendars from each of their classes into one complete calendar. They request the AI model to send them links to each of their course calendars and download them to their computer. They then export each calendar into their personal dashboard to view them all at once. | R1, R3, RS13 |
| **UC-2** | Maintaining Student Privacy | A student requests to view their friendâ€™s grade for the recent midterm. The AI model detects that the user is not authorized to view the requested material, so it politely but firmly declines. | R5, R8, RS8 |
| **UC-3** | Detecting Drop in Participation | The AI model notifies the lecturer that participation with assignments has decreased significantly over the last month. The lecturer requests to view the average GPA of their class and sees that it has lowered. They make an announcement offering extra credit for bonus assignments. | RL2, RL6, RL7 |
