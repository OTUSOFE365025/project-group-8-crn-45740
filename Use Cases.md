# Use Case Models for AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)

| **Use Case ID** | **Use Case Name** | **Description** | **Functional Requirement ID** |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **UC-1** | Merge Multiple Calendars | A student wishes to combine calendars from each of their classes into one complete calendar. They request the AI model to send them links to each of their course calendars and download them to their computer. They then export each calendar into their personal dashboard to view them all at once. | R1, R3, RS13 |
| **UC-2** | Maintaining Student Privacy | A student requests to view their friendâ€™s grade for the recent midterm. The AI model detects that the user is not authorized to view the requested material, so it politely but firmly declines. | R5, R8, RS8 |
| **UC-3** | Detecting Drop in Participation | The AI model notifies the lecturer that participation with assignments has decreased significantly over the last month. The lecturer requests to view the average GPA of their class and sees that it has lowered. They make an announcement offering extra credit for bonus assignments. | RL2, RL6, RL7 |
| **UC-4** | UC-4: Server maintenance | The AI model encounters an exploit in the system causing user data to be compromised. The System Maintainer updates the code without needing to shut down the server, and the administrator is able to rollback the data to a point before the exploit occurred. | RM1, RM6, RA6 |
| **UC-5** | UC-5: High traffic operations | Thousands of students are sending requests to the assistant just before exam season begins. The model is able to handle the majority of requests within 2 seconds despite the high load. Failures are quickly reattempted and logged within the system. | RS1, RS10, RA7, RD3 |
| **UC-6** | UC-6: Referencing chat history | The student uses the assistant to help with studying for an exam over the course of a week. The assistant is able to pick up where they left off the previous session by analyzing the previous messages in the chat. The assistant is also able to explain concepts in a way that the student can understand, based on their chat history. | R1, R6, RS5 |
