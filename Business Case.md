# **Business Case - AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform**

*Problem Statement:*
Many institutions rely on multiple disconnected systems, such as Learning Management Systems, academic registration portals, email, calendar applications, etc. to manage academic and administrative information. This can cause information to get lost and or skewed through multiple manual uploads across a variety of platforms, creating an inconsistency in communication and a delay in information. In addition, many of these current systems lack real time assistance, and accessibility, causing frustration among users. 

*Proposed Solution:*
The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) enhances the academic experience for students, faculty and administrators by providing a user-friendly conversational interface with services backed by institutional data. The AI-Powered assistant integrates with university systems (LMS, registration, calendars, and email) to generate and deliver text based answers in a one stop shop. 

*Stakeholders:*
The AIDAP streamlines students, lecturers and administrative abilities into a platform that is one stop shop for all the required needs of its users. The platform's UI provides for a simplified chatbot based experience where a user(Student, lecturer, admin, etc.) can in a conversational based format to gain access to required sets of information or to input new information. The platform contains many benefits to its stakeholders, including but not limited to the following:

Students:
- Instant access to schedules, deadlines and academic calendar 
- Personalized notifications and dashboard to fit the users needs
- Multi- Language support 
- 24/7 Availability

Lecturers:
- Automated email and announcement responses to students and courses
- Simplified course management 
- Class/ Student analytics 

Administrators:
- Centralized platform 
- Campus wide (and farther) communications 
- Usage Statistics 
- Improved efficiency in solving support related problems 

System Maintainers:
- Defined and logical architecture
- Centralized monitoring 
- Cloud-native 

*Project Scope:*
AI-Driven web application developed as a cloud-native product, integrated with existing institutional systems. 
- Implementing a conversational user based interface design 
	- Future extensions applicable (Such as voice integration)
- Connecting existing applications (Such as LMS, calendar, etc)
- Implementing a customization feature to create personalized features 
- Ensuring little to no downtime, secure data handling and scalability
- Including analytical features to improve upon existing models 

*Expected outcome (Vision):*
Fully functional and customizable AI assistant for students, lecturers, and administrative personnel, that eliminates the use of multiple platforms by creating a cross platform application. AIDAP will serve as a single access point for all academic, administrative and technical support, enhancing the experience for learners and teachers. 

*Risks:*
- Improper handling of secure information, leading to unauthorized data access, violating users accounts and privacy 
- AI accuracy - early versions of the model may generate inaccurate results due to lack in training data
- Compatibility issues with multi system integration 
- High user load leading to a delay in response time
- Extensive amounts of time required for constant training and monitoring of the models responses.
