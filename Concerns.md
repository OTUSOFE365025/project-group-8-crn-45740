# **Architectual Concerns for AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)**

| **ID** | **Concern** |
|---------|-------------|
| **CRN-1** | The architecture must account for the AI assistant's lack of domain-specific knowledge. Early versions may produce inaccurate and faulty results due to lack of training and collected data (R5, RS5, RM3). |
| **CRN-2** | The architecture must prevent the exposure of sensitive information by the AI system. Access restrictions and response filtering should be integrated within the system (R5, R8, RS8, RL8, RA5). |
| **CRN-3** | The architecture must aim for zero to minimal downtime (R7, RA6, RS11, RM1). |
| **CRN-4** | The architecture must implement error handling across all layers, while logging errors with necessary context for monitoring and later incident review (RA6, RM4, RM6). |
| **CRN-5** | Clear defined logically structured architecture (R1, R3, R7, RM5). |
| **CRN-6** | Secure handling of data within external applications through system authentication (R3, RD1, RD2, RD3). |
| **CRN-7** | Conversational context and user history compiled securely to deliver personalized content (R2, R6, RS5, RS8). |
| **CRN-8** | Leverage the use of external applications for automated backup support and data preservation (R7, RA6, RM6). |
